## Main Question of Interest

Does the number of years of full-time work experience a person have influence their self-rated enjoyment of the MDS program?

## Questions & Justifications

The following are questions that will be asked in our survey so as to investigate our main question of interest: 

1. Number of years of full-time work experience you have.
	
	- __Main covariate__: number of years of full-tiem work experience
	- __Type__: ordinal
	- __Options__: (1) less than 1 year, (2) 1-3 years, (3) 3-5 year, (4) more than 5 years

2. What is your field of study? 

	- __Confounding variable__: field of study
	- __Type__: categorical
	- __Options__: (1) Science, (2) Engineering, (3) Business, (4) Arts
	- __Justification__: It is a confounding variable since we think it will influence the enjoyment of the program besides our main covariate. For example, a person with science or engineering degree may less struggle with the topics taught in the program and thus becomes more enjoyable.

3. What is your level of education entering the program? 
	
	- __Confounding variable__: level of education
	- __Type__: ordinal
	- __Options__: (1) Bachelors, (2) Masters and above
	- __Justification__: It is selected to be a confounding variable since we think it will also affect the enjoyment of the program. For instance, a PhD student may have a better understanding of Math and data anlysis, which may accelerate his/her undstanding of the topics and enjoy the program.

4. Number of years of full-time work experience that are applicable to the program.

	- __Confounding variable__: Number of years of related full-time work experience
	- __Type__: ordinal
	- __Options__: (1) less than 1 year, (2) 1-3 years, (3) 3-5 year, (4) more than 5 years
	- __Justification__: It is selected to be a confounding variable since we think it will also affect the enjoyment of the program.

5. Number of years of coding experience?

	- __Confounding variable__: Number of years of coding experience
	- __Type__: ordinal
	- __Options__: (1) less than 1 year, (2) 1-3 years, (3) 3-5 year, (4) more than 5 years
	- __Justification__: It is selected to be a confounding variable since we think it will also affect the enjoyment of the program. A person are familiar with Python/R may finish his/her tasks more quickly and thus enjoy this program.

6. What is your self-rated enjoyment of MDS program?

	- __Response variable__: self-rated enjoyment of MDS program
	- __Type__: ordinal
	- __Options__: (1) 1 (very disappointed), (2) 2 (disappointed), (3) 3 (ok), (4) 4 (enjoy), (5) 5 (enthusiastically enjoy)

## Plan to Analyze the Survey Results

Null hypothesis: The number of years of full-time work experience a person does not influence their self-rated enjoyment of the MDS program.

Alternative hypothesis: The number of years of full-time work experience a person influences their self-rated enjoyment of the MDS program.

We plan to perform a test for independence between the self-rated enjoyment of the MDS program and the number of years of full-time work experience to determine if there is a correlation.

## UBC Office of Research Ethics Implications

Our survey will not violate the BC Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA) because we are not asking any personally identifiable information. As a result, we will be using Google Forms as our survey platform because the survey will be completed anonymously. A cover letter will be used instead of a full signed consent form because this is study will be limited to the online survey. The information needed by the participant to make an informed decision about participating in the survey study will be included in the survey. This includes: the study title, contact information of the PI, a short description of the study, risks and benefits, limits to confidentiality, a statement that participation is optional, and the UBC Research Participant Complaint Line text. See [UBC Office of Research Ethics document](https://ethics.research.ubc.ca/sites/ore.ubc.ca/files/documents/Online_Survey-GN.pdf) for full details.

Here is the cover letter:
> Dear MDS students: 
>
> We are graduate students of Data Science at University of British Columbia. For our project, we are examining how the number of years of full-time work experience a person has influence their self-rated enjoyment of the MDS program. Because you are a graduate student of Data Science, we are inviting you to participate in this research study by completing this survey. 
>
> The following questionnaire will require approximately 5 mins to complete. There is no compensation for responding nor is there any known risk. In order to ensure that all information will remain confidential, please do not include your name. Copies of our project will be public to MDS instructors and other MDS students. If you choose to participate in this project, please answer all questions as honestly as possible. This survey will not violate the BC Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA), and participation is strictly voluntary and you may refuse to participate at any time. 
>
> Thank you for taking the time to assist me in our educational endeavors. Completion and submission of the questionnaire will indicate your willingness to participate in this study.
