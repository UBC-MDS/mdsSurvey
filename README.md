## Main Question

Does the number of years of full-time work experience a person have influence their self-rated enjoyment of the MDS program (scale of 1-5, 1 being do not enjoy and 5 being enthusiastically enjoy)?

## Other questions & justifications

1. What is your field of study? (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math, Business, Arts, Life Sciences)
2. Level of education entering the program? (Bachelors, Masters, PhD)
3. Number of years of full-time work experience that are applicable to the program.
4. Number of years of coding experience?

The questions identified above were selected because we hypothesize that these variables will influence the overall enjoyment of the program. I.e. there could be a disproportional number of people who enjoy the program based on their field of study.

## Plan to analyze the survey results

We plan to perform a test for independence between the self-rated enjoyment of the MDS program and the number of years of full-time work experience to determine if there is a correlation.
