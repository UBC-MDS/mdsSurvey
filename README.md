## Main Question

Does the number of years of full-time work experience a person have influence their self-rated enjoyment of the MDS program (scale of 1-5, 1 being do not enjoy and 5 being enthusiastically enjoy)?

## Other questions & justifications

1. What is your field of study? (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math, Business, Arts, Life Sciences)
2. Level of education entering the program? (Bachelors, Masters, PhD)
3. Number of years of full-time work experience that are applicable to the program.
4. Number of years of coding experience?

The questions identified above were selected because we hypothesize that these variables will influence the overall enjoyment of the program. I.e. there could be a disproportional number of people who enjoy the program based on their field of study.

## Plan to analyze the survey results

We plan to perform a test for independence between the self-rated enjoyment of the MDS program and the number of years of full-time work experience to determine if there is a correlation.

## UBC Office of Research Ethics implications

Our survey will not violate the BC Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA) because we are not asking any personally identifiable information. As a result, we will be using Google Forms as our survey platform because the survey will be completed anonymously. A cover letter will be used instead of a full signed consent form because this is study will be limited to the online survey. The information needed by the participant to make an informed decision about participating in the survey study will be included in the survey. This includes: the study title, contact information of the PI, a short description of the study, risks and benefits, limits to confidentiality, a statement that participation is optional, and the UBC Research Participant Complaint Line text.
