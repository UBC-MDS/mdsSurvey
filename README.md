## Main Question of Interest

Does the number of years of full-time work experience a person have influence their self-rated enjoyment of the MDS program?

## Project set-up

### Collaboration

We will use branching and merging collaboration strategy throughout this project.

### Survey

The survey tool we used in this project is [Google Forms](https://www.google.ca/forms/about/) and the survey is available [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1QrNYvn0P4onULul_vpk-O2qhC2TPzsVab191ENNjKQs/viewform?edit_requested=true).

### Analysis

All future analysis will be conducted in a private repo on github.ubc.ca, [Work\_Experience\_MDS\_Enjoyment](https://github.ubc.ca/MDS-2018-19/Work_Experience_MDS_Enjoyment) to ensure privacy of survey results.

This repo includes:

1. [Collected data](https://github.ubc.ca/MDS-2018-19/Work_Experience_MDS_Enjoyment/blob/master/data/survey_results.csv)
2. [Exploratory data analysis](https://github.ubc.ca/MDS-2018-19/Work_Experience_MDS_Enjoyment/blob/master/survey_eda.ipynb)
